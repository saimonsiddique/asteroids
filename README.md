# Asteroids Game

## Introduction
This project is a simulation of the classic Asteroids game. It is built as a practice project for better understanding Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

## Features
- **Asteroid Generation**: Randomly generates asteroids that move across the screen.
- **Player Control**: Allows the player to control a spaceship to avoid and destroy asteroids.
- **Collision Detection**: Detects collisions between the player, asteroids, and shots.
- **Shooting Mechanism**: Allows the player to shoot projectiles to destroy asteroids.
- **Game Over Condition**: Ends the game when the player's spaceship collides with an asteroid.

## Installation
To install and run the project, follow these steps:
1. **Clone the repository**:
  ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/saimonsiddique/asteroids.git
   cd asteroids
  ```

2. **Install the dependencies**:
  Ensure you have Python3 and Pygame installed. If not, install Pygame using pip:
  ```sh
